_General ideas and questions


The generation effect refers to the finding that subjects who generate information (e.g., produce synonyms) remember the information better than they do material that they simply read.

“Забота о радости”: Осознанный поиск действий, приносящих позитивные эмоции. Делать что-то только ради того, что оно приносит тебе радость. Больше ни для чего. (делать что-то руками)

A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple system. – John Gall

For example, a few months ago, a highlight about survivorship bias came up. This cognitive bias points out that we don’t adequately value the information not present. We may be inclined to say that ‘old buildings are more beautiful’ when in fact, when you think about it, only the beautiful old buildings survive. The ugly ones are torn down, and new ones will take their place. 

First, I eliminated basically all recurring meetings except board meetings. Whenever I got meeting requests, I filtered them in one of four ways: 1) If the meeting actually required a call, I’d ask the person to shoot me a text or Whatsapp. A couple times/week I’d go on a walk, open my messages, and start calling people to connect. 2) If the meeting was necessary but didn’t require a live convo I’d ask the person to send me a voice note via text or Whatsapp with the problem/situation. Communicating asynchronously replaced 80% of meetings. 3) Any meetings that were absolutely necessary to schedule in advance, we’d batch into a block on the same day. 4) I ruthlessly eliminated the rest. For examples, at Athena we instituted a max one meeting per week policy. I also had my EA send me a calendar analysis once/quarter to track how many hours of meetings I had, which helped me get more ruthless over the course of the year.

Text benefits from two economic coincidences: it has a low marginal cost today, but it used to have a very high one. So older writing is more likely to contain information that smart people with cash on hand thought was absolutely essential, while newer writing is cheaper to produce and easier to search than other kinds of content, so if there’s one specific piece of information you need, you’re more likely to find it in text than anywhere else.

Two player playing together in chess with ELO 1200 can win a grandmaster with much higher ELO.  Think pair programming

Silence is important. Our society is focused on noise and not on silence.

Just as there are smells we cannot smell and sounds we cannot hear, there are thoughts we cannot think. (hamming)

If our ancestors couldn’t function when they were hungry, we wouldn’t be here. Short term adaptation to starvation is beneficial.

Idea from Sivers re parenting: never stop your kid if he’s doing something. Cultivate attention span. Let him finish what he’s doing.

Schools are kindergartens for older kids intended to keep them busy while parents are working. You quickly learn what you need to do/practice and you forget everything else. There is no need for kids to stay at school for so long. If they could learn only what is needed/interesting, they can be done in 3 hours and go back to playing/roaming the city streets if they were safe enough of course.

Happiness is relative to conditions before/after it was achieved. Think running marathon, you’re comparing yourself at the finish vs yourself 1 hour ago and happy

The general rule seems to be: systems which eat items quickly are fed more items. Slow systems starve. Examples: google, slow/fast coworkers

Most people complicate to profit

How do you know you’re not sleeping now?

speak using nouns (as in “pass me the drink”) instead of using demonstratives (“pass me this”)

most of the time when people disagree, they are simply aware of different information

Always think about how can we complete things that should take 5 years in 5 months? Weeks?

The only way to understand a book and take something out of it is to really think about what you’re reading, asking questions, writing summaries, making notes etc.

The Malthusian Trap is the theory that, as population growth is ahead of agricultural growth, there must be a stage at which the food supply is inadequate for feeding the population

Henry Kissinger has a famous quote, referring to his time at Harvard: “The battles were so fierce because the stakes were so small.” This isn’t merely an observation; this is in fact a causative relationship: the smaller, the pettier, the more insignificant the challenge, the more comically and sullenly people will obsess and fight over it. Why is this? Because tiny stakes imply similar participants; often peers or neighbours.

Fire Bullets, Then Cannonballs is a concept developed in the book Great by Choice. First, you fire bullets (low-cost, low-risk, low-distraction experiments) to figure out what will work—calibrating your line of sight by taking small shots. Then, once you have empirical validation, you fire a cannonball (concentrating resources into a big bet) on the calibrated line of sight. Calibrated cannonballs correlate with outsized results; uncalibrated cannonballs correlate with disaster. The ability to turn small proven ideas (bullets) into huge hits (cannonballs) counts more than the sheer amount of pure innovation.

The essence of systems thinking: Every persistent biological or cultural structure exists because of a positive feedback loop. Sometimes it’s hard to see. But to understand the structure, you must understand the loop.

If you go for vacation and it’s mostly unpleasant but the final day is great, you will treat it mostly as a nice experience. And vice versa.

We prefer to see “winners” as “naturally talented” rather than “hard working.” Because if it were reversed, what would that imply about us? (cont.): People prefer successful individuals whose achievements are based on talent (“naturals”), but hold ordinary persons dearer if their abilities stem from effort ("strivers").

Observe your emotions to understand yourself

Not wanting something is as good as having it.

Boredom is simply a lack of attention

Silence is golden. Do not be afraid of pauses https://ubiquity.acm.org/article.cfm?id=3310318

Дело > слово. Если научился делать успешно - можешь рассказывать как.

Try asking yourself how "How do I feel about what I'm feeling?"

Look for what’s looking

Fast talkers are people who articulately and assertively say things faster than they can be assessed as a way of pushing their agenda past other people’s examination or objections. Fast talking can be especially effective when it’s used against people worried about appearing stupid. Don’t be one of those people. Recognize that it’s your responsibility to make sense of things and don’t move on until you do. If you’re feeling pressured, say something like, “Sorry for being stupid, but I’m going to need to slow you down so I can make sense of what you’re saying.” Then ask your questions. All of them.

Дожить до 100 лет: какие движения будут нужны для того, чтобы человек испытывал полноценную жизнь в сто лет?

How to acquire knowledge. Постоянное перечитывание конспекта, статьи, страниц книги или обращение у Гуглу дает иллюзию, что материал присутствует в сознании. Но это не всегда так. Вспоминание гораздо эффективнее перечитывания. Прочтите — повторите по памяти — прочтите снова. Постарайтесь вспомнить что-нибудь из изученного за день, расскажите своими словами жене или другу, запишите. Так знание прилипнет.

The Spotlight Effect: People overestimate how much others are paying attention to them and so are too easily embarrassed and too worried about public disapproval .

The Focusing Illusion, nicely summed up as “Nothing in life is quite as important as you think it is while you are thinking about it.” We overestimate the significance of what we're worried about. (It's usually not that bad.)

When Michlen started, there were only 3000 cars and it was really hard to build a business selling tires to 3000 owners. So Michlen decided to force them to move more and created the Michlen guide for restaurants, giving it for free to drives.

Фундаментальная ошибка атрибуции — это склонность человека объяснять поступки и поведение других людей их личностными особенностями (так называемой «внутренней диспозицией»), а собственное поведение — внешними обстоятельствами (так называемой «внешней диспозицией»).

People, in general, are terrible at valuing their time, perhaps because for most people monetary compensation for one's time is so detached from the event of spending one's time. Therefore poor people hate to pay for delivery and are eager to get their groceries themselves and ultra rich fly private and hire servants.

The actual rules of how everything works are incredibly resistant to being written down or spoken because people who are best at getting it get it by not getting it. They don’t understand it with words, they understand it with muscles, bones and brains. <> If the actual rules become published, you have to change the actual rules.
